This page summarizes the official AI Scientist Challenge Rules (Version 2025.11.11). All participants must comply with the submission workflow, technical constraints, and evaluation procedures described below.
1. Submission Requirements
1.1 Submission Channel

Participants must provide:

    A .zip file containing the complete project, structured according to the required format.
    If deployment requires extra environment variables (e.g., academic API keys), include a complete .env file inside the same package.
    Teams competing in multiple tracks must submit a separate questionnaire for each track, with exactly one code package per submission.

The Organizing Committee distributes a private questionnaire link by email before 21:00 on November 11 (UTC+8), enabling upload of the .zip package.
1.2 Code Structure Requirements

Projects must follow the required structure and be submitted as a .zip file through the questionnaire link. An official example project is available at GitHub.

Repository requirements (root directory):

    Dockerfile (image build script)
        Base image must be:

        python:3.12-slim-bookworm

        Additional dependencies are unrestricted (e.g., local vector stores, OpenAI SDK, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen).
        The Docker image must be buildable within mainland China’s network environment.
    docker-compose.yml for service deployment
        The service must expose port 3000 and map it correctly.
    .env.example listing exactly these seven variables:
        SCI_MODEL_BASE_URL (to be set to https://api.deepseek.com)
        SCI_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL (to be set to https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1)
        SCI_EMBEDDING_API_KEY (filled in by the Organizing Committee)
        SCI_MODEL_API_KEY (filled in by the Organizing Committee)
        SCI_LLM_MODEL ("deepseek-chat")
        SCI_LLM_REASONING_MODEL ("deepseek-reasoner")
        SCI_EMBEDDING_MODEL ("text-embedding-v4")

Participants can use DeepSeek’s official services (deepseek-chat / deepseek-reasoner) and Alibaba Cloud Bailian’s text-embedding-v4 model for local development and testing to keep interfaces consistent with the evaluation environment.

If extra environment variables are required, include a complete .env file in the submission package. It must still contain the seven model-related variables above, with values left empty for the organizers. All model information must be read via environment variables.
Daily Deployment Schedule

The system deploys all new submission packages at 11:00 (UTC+8) each day. Each team should upload no more than one update per day.

    If an updated version is submitted, the new build replaces the previous deployment in the arena. Past evaluation data is retained, and the leaderboard adds a date suffix to distinguish versions.
    If no new submission is uploaded, the current version continues to participate without change.

2. Compliance
2.1 Deployment Environment

    All services run on dedicated Alibaba Cloud ECS instances located in mainland China with 2 cores / 4 GB RAM / 50 GB disk.
    Each repository is loaded onto a dedicated server for code scanning, image building, and deployment.
    The environment ships with the latest Docker, docker-compose, and the python:3.12-slim-bookworm base image.
    Participants must ensure external APIs required by their service are accessible from within mainland China.

2.2 Access to External Services
2.2.1 Access to LLM Services

    The Organizing Committee provides official LLM and embedding models only during deployment and evaluation; API keys are not shared during development.
    The following models are used during evaluation:
        deepseek-chat
        deepseek-reasoner
        Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-4B
    Systems must rely solely on these models during evaluation. Use of any external or third-party model APIs is strictly prohibited.
    Reference documentation:
        DeepSeek API
        Alibaba Model Studio (Bailian) Embedding API
        Example submission project

2.2.2 Access to Academic APIs

Only the following academic data APIs may be accessed. Participants must implement throttling and error handling to respect any rate limits.

    OpenAlex
    Semantic Scholar
    Unpaywall
    Crossref
    OpenReview
    arXiv

No other academic APIs may be used without explicit approval. All submitted code is scanned and verified to preserve fairness.
3. API Specifications

Services must return responses in streaming Markdown via Server-Sent Events (SSE). Any other response format will be filtered.
